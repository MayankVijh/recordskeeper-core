Getting Started
===============

This tutorial requires you to setup a RecordsKeeper. If you have not done so already, please download and install RecordsKeeper on a server. If you are using MultiChain on Windows, please read the Installation on Windows notes on the previous page to adapt the instructions below.

Download the latest `RecordsKeeper <https://demo.recordskeeper.co/basic-demo/>`_ build and put the downloded files under the root folder. You can also run these commands from the folder where the files are present.

Connecting to RecordsKeeper Blockchain
--------------------------------------

To connect to RecordsKeeper Blockchain run the following command in bash or command prompt.

RecordsKeeper Testnet

.. code-block:: bash

    rkd recordskeeper-test@35.170.155.89:8379 -daemon

RecordsKeeper Mainnet

.. code-block:: bash

    rkd recordskeeper@35.172.1.247:7345 -daemon

When you run the above commands the create a node connected to the RecordsKeeper Main node. The command will automatically sets the permissions and consensus required for the Blockchain.

RecordsKeeper Testnet is a complete open Blockchain, when you connect to the Testnet you will have the permissions to connect, send, recieve and mine but the RecordsKeeper Mainnet is currently under consensus rule for a certain number of Blocks (You can read more about that in the `RecordsKeeper Whitepaper <https://www.recordskeeper.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/rk_whitepaper.pdf>`_) to avoid takeovers. When you connect to the RecordsKeeper Mainnet, you will recieve an address. You can send that address to us through `RecordsKeeper Mining Permission <https://www.recordskeeper.co/contact-us/>`_ .

Interactive Command Line Mode
-----------------------------

Before we proceed, letâ€™s enter interactive mode so we can issue commands to interact with RecordsKeeper Blockchain.

Testnet

.. code-block:: bash

    rk-cli recordskeeper-test

Mainnet

.. code-block:: bash

    rk-cli recordskeeper

Some Basic Commands
-------------------

Now your node is up and running you can issue some basic commands in the interactive mode to get some feel about the RecordsKeeper

To get general information about the RecordsKeeper Node:

.. code-block:: bash

    getinfo

See a list of all available commands for the RecordsKeeper Node:

.. code-block:: bash

    help

Create a new address in the RecordsKeeper Node wallet:

.. code-block:: bash

    getnewaddress

List you all addresses in the RecordsKeeper Node wallet:

.. code-block:: bash

    getaddresses

Sending a Transaction in RecordsKeeper
--------------------------------------

The RecordsKeeper Blockchain works on the same backend as Bitcoin algorithms. Both the RecordsKeeper Testnet and Mainnet can be used to send and recieve XRK tokens. Use the following interactive commands to send transactions in RecordsKeeper Blockchain.

Send
####

.. code-block:: bash
  
    send address amount (comment) (comment-to)
    Example: send 1KJFg5YLpvYNYZtCM6hhNYW8uBKtc3GHVboXco 10

This command is used to Send one or more XRK tokens to address, returning the txid. The amount field is the quantity of the XRK token and the address field is the address where you want to send the XRK tokens. This command will use the Node's root address to send the transaction. Please make sure you have sufficient balance in the Node's root address for transaction to propogate over the RecordsKeeper Blockchain. You can also provide specific comments for the transaction which are optional. The fees will be applied as per the transaction size.

Send from a different address
#############################

.. code-block:: bash

    sendfrom from-address to-address amount
    Example: sendfrom 1KJFg5YLpvYNYZtCM6hhNYW8uBKtc3GHVboXco 17gddiicYtbnwnWuY2ZYvM1Rw9e7t3pPjNJPab 10

This command is also used to Send one or more XRK tokens to address, returning the txid. Using this command you can specify the from address which you want to use to send the transaction. The amount field is the quantity of the XRK token and the to-address field is the address where you want to send the XRK tokens. Please make sure you have sufficient balance in the from-address for transaction to propogate over the RecordsKeeper Blockchain. The from-address used here is also one of the address generated for the Node. You can also provide specific comments for the transaction which are optional. The fees will be applied as per the transaction size.

Publishing and Retriving data in RecordsKeeper
----------------------------------------------

The RecordsKeeper Blockchain is a open public Key-Value based Database over the Blockchain. You can use the interactive command line to publish and retirive stored information. As the Blockahin is a shared concept you can view all the published data and retrive it only using a key or address. RecordsKeeper uses the streams to store the data. RecordsKeeper Streams provide a natural abstraction for RecordsKeeper blockchain which focus on general data retrieval, timestamping and archiving, rather than the transfer of tokens between participants.

The "root" stream is open to all and anyone can publish data into the root stream. Following commands will give you a brief about how to work with data over RecordsKeeper Blockchain.

Publish
#######

.. code-block:: bash

    publish stream key data-hex
    Example: publish root rkKey 57687920796f7520636f6e766572746564206d653f

This command publishes an item in stream, the stream name is passed, with key provided in text form and data-hex in hexadecimal format. It returns ref or creation txid. The data is published using the Node's address. Use the next command discussed below to publish data from different address. The mining fees is applied as per the transaction size.

Publish from a different address
################################

.. code-block:: bash

    publishfrom from-address stream key data-hex
    Example: publishfrom 1KJFg5YLpvYNYZtCM6hhNYW8uBKtc3GHVboXco root rkKey 596f7520636f6e766572746564206d6520616761696e3f

This command works like publish, but publishes the item from from-address. It is useful if the node has multiple addresses with different amounts. The mining fees is applied as per the transaction size.

Send as Transaction
###################

.. code-block:: bash

    sendwithdata/sendwithmetadata address amount data-hex|object
    Example: sendwithdata 1KJFg5YLpvYNYZtCM6hhNYW8uBKtc3GHVboXco 0 {"for":root,"key":"rkKey","data":"506c656173652073746f7020646f696e67207468697321"}

This works similar to send, but with an additional data-only transaction output. You can pass raw data as data-hex hexadecimal string. It is also used to publish the data to a stream, pass an object like this {"for":StreamName,"key":"KeyName","data":"DataHex"} where stream is a stream name, ref or creation txid, the key is in text form, and the data is hexadecimal. You can pass the amount as 0, if you are only using this to publish the data over the RecordsKeeper stream. You can also send some XRK tokens while publishing the data over the stream. The fees will be applied as per the transaction size.
