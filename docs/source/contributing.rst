We encourage open source contribution!

To get started, you can try Building from Source in order to familiarize yourself with the components of RecordsKeeper and the build process. Also, it may be useful to become well-versed with command line functions for RecordsKeeper.

In particular, we need help in the following areas:

    Improving the documentation
    Responding to questions from other users on StackExchange and the RecordsKeeper Github
    Fixing and responding to RecordsKeeper GitHub issues, especially those tagged as up-for-grabs which are meant as introductory issues for external contributors.

How to Report Issues
--------------------

To report an issue, please use the GitHub issues tracker. When reporting issues, please mention the following details:

* Which version of RecordsKeeper you are using
* What was the source code (if applicable)
* Which platform are you running on
* How to reproduce the issue
* What was the result of the issue
* What the expected behaviour is

Reducing the source code that caused the issue to a bare minimum is always very helpful and sometimes even clarifies a misunderstanding.

Workflow for Pull Requests
--------------------------

In order to contribute, please fork off of the develop branch and make your changes there. Your commit messages should detail why you made your change in addition to what you did and would it affect the other parts of the RecordsKeeper.

If you need to pull in any changes from develop after making your fork (for example, to resolve potential merge conflicts), please avoid using git merge and instead, git rebase your branch.

Additionally, if you are writing a new feature, please ensure you write appropriate unit test cases and place them under test/.

However, if you are making a larger change, please consult with the RecordsKeeper Development Team.

Finally, please make sure you respect the coding standards for this project. Also, even though we do CI testing, please test your code and ensure that it builds locally before submitting a pull request.

Thank you for your help!
